# Cornell Classmates

This project, built using Google AppEngine, is a simple utility for Cornellians to input the classes they're taking and to find friends in their classes. It is highly extensible to other school systems as well, so feel free to fork it!

## Setup

Simply download this repository, add it under the App Engine SDK, and you should be good to get it running.

## DISCLAIMER

This app, in its current form, is very insecure. Passwords are not hashed, the system is supremely vulernable to form injection, and relies on the Cornell community to not fuck it up. By using this service, you agree to "Fair Use", which means that you will not diminish the utility of the service for your own personal gain (whose definition includes, but is not limited to, any fun you may find in pranks).
